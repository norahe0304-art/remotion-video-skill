# Remotion Video Skill

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED — Superseded by [30x-video](https://github.com/norahe0304-art/30x-video).**
>
> This skill is no longer actively developed. Its taste philosophy
> (`rules/taste.md`, `rules/finish-gate.md`, `rules/archetypes.md`) and
> engine-neutral scripts (beat-sync, scene-constitution, evidence-model,
> visual-audit, timing-audit, critique-scenes) have been ported to
> 30x-video, which uses **Hyperframes** (Apache 2.0, HTML+GSAP) instead
> of Remotion as the rendering engine.
>
> 30x-video adds:
> - Refero MCP integration for design-library search
> - Auto-composed voice over (multi-provider TTS) and BGM
> - Confirmation Gate before render (zero rework)
> - 5-dimensional Style Composer (replaces fixed templates)
> - 50-video real-reference library (instead of abstract rules)
>
> Use 30x-video for new work. This repo remains for reference.

Generate premium 40-second product launch videos with Claude Code + Remotion. Give it a brand URL, and the skill builds around real website evidence, enterprise-grade taste, and product-faithful motion instead of generic SaaS templates.

## URL-to-Video V2

The skill now includes a real URL intake orchestrator. Preferred flow:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types <installed-skill-dir>/scripts/url-to-video.ts https://brand.com --out ./brand-launch-video
```

It emits a **team-editable first cut project**, not a black-box final render. Every generated project includes:

- `brand-report.json`
- `scene-constitution.json`
- `asset-manifest.json`
- `story.md`
- `review.md`
- `src/generated/project-data.ts`
- `public/brand/beat-map.json` when BGM harvest succeeds

For regression coverage across canonical brands:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types <installed-skill-dir>/scripts/benchmark-suite.ts --match stripe-fintech --offline --reuse-brand-dir ./public/brand --install --verify --render
```

This writes per-benchmark `benchmark-result.json` files plus one suite summary.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add norahe0304-art/remotion-video-skill -g
```

Or project-level:

```bash
npx skills add norahe0304-art/remotion-video-skill
```

## Usage

Just tell Claude Code:

> "Make a launch video for linear.app"

The skill will scrape the brand, ask for your storyline, build animated UI mockups, add BGM, and render to MP4.
In V2, the default is stronger: it can turn one URL into a mode-aware editable first cut, choose between `product-evidence` and `editorial`, keep audio `BGM-only`, generate a beat-map when music exists, and leave the last 10-20% of polish to Claude or a human in Remotion.

## What Changed

- Added a **three-layer constitution**: phenomenal evidence, archetype inference, and finish-gate philosophy
- Added **enterprise design archetypes** abstracted from high-quality design references
- Added an **Impeccable-style finish gate** to reject monoculture defaults before render
- Upgraded the workflow so **screenshots are mandatory** and **video is preferred**
- Added a **URL-to-video orchestrator** that emits reports, scene constitution, and a Remotion-ready project from one URL
- Added an **executable benchmark suite runner** for 12+ canonical URLs across product-heavy and editorial-heavy brands
- Kept the existing `SKILL.md -> rules -> scaffold` production chain intact

## What's Inside

**3,200+ lines of rules** across 13 files, **4,100+ lines of bundled Remotion API reference**, **1,900+ lines of scaffold code**, and **5 reference files** with copy-paste components.

### Bundled Remotion API Reference (remotion-best-practices/)
37 Remotion-specific rule files covering videos, audio, timing, transitions, compositions, fonts, images, charts, captions, 3D, maps, and more. No external dependency needed.

### Scaffold (scaffold/)
Ready-to-run Remotion project template that acts as the first-cut receiver for `scene-constitution`, generated project data, and harvested brand evidence inside `public/brand/`.

## Battle-Tested

Built and validated across 8 real brand videos: Google Gemini, Linear, Mercury, Shopify, 1Password, Notion, Cursor, and Anthropic. Every rule comes from a real bug or a real design review — not theory.
